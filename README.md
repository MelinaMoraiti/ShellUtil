# ShellUtil
This repository contains a collection of shell scripts developed as part of my coursework during an Operating Systems course in the 3rd semester. These scripts automate various system tasks such as backups, process management, directory comparison, and file searching. Simplify your system administration tasks with these handy shell utilities! 🛠️
